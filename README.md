Â¡Palabras Among Amigos!
======================

A TermsWithChums spinoff, implemented as client/server.

Goals:

  - have the server be really nice
  - have at least one client that is acceptable (web - probably Backbone or Angular)
  - have a computer player mode that can hold it's own against really good humans (given a reasonable time limit per move - a few minutes or something)  
  
First round interation hacked together with [Dropwizard](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard) and [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
